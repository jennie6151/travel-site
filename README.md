This project required me to create a site that calls on the Google Maps API and/or the Google Places API (or similar) to allow users to search for their next holiday destination.
This website is motivated by that brief and uses the criteria supplied. It was imperative that I help users to:
* Select a destination city
* Find tourist attractions
* Find accommodation
* Find bars and restaurants

I also added travel as a filter option as I felt this was imperative for a travel site that helped tourists search for upcoming holidays.

I have made the site responsive so users can use this single page application whilst on the go.

## Built with
* <https://balsamiq.com/>
    * Used to create mock ups of the site which have been uploaded as PDF files
* **Html**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**
    * Base languages used to create the site
* **Cloud9**
    * Code editor used to write above code
* **JQuery**
    *
* **Bootstrap** 3.3.7
    * Web framework used
* **Google maps api**
* **Google place api**
* **Github**
    * Platform used to host my versioning
* Other resources used: **Fontawesome**, **Googlefonts**

## Versioning
I used Git for versioning on this project.

## Testing
The testing that I completed for this project is listed below:
* Ran my html code through a code checker (https://validator.w3.org/)
* Ran my css code through a code checker (https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator)
* Asked colleagues, friends and family to check this site and access from their own devices; any small changes were made and committed.
* Used incognito mode on Chrome to remove all cached data.
* Checked every feature worked (and looked consistent) in both Google Chrome and Internet Explorer 10.
* Used https://www.responsinator.com to test how well the website responded to different device sizes.

## Acknowledgments/credits
