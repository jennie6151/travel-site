## Overview
### What is this website for?
This project required me to create a site that calls on the Google Maps API and/or the Google Places API (or similar) to allow users to search for their next holiday destination.

### What does this website do?
This website is motivated by that brief and uses the criteria supplied. It was imperative that I create a site that helps users to:
* Select a destination city
* Find tourist attractions
* Find accommodation
* Find bars and restaurants
* I also added travel as a filter option as I felt this was imperative for a travel site that helped tourists search for upcoming holidays.

### How does it work?
This website uses the **Google Maps api** and the **Google Places api** allowing users to search for a holiday destination.

The site uses plain **HTML** and **CSS** to route users to search and filter destinations which, depending on their search style, controls which **JavaScript** to execute.

The **Google Maps api** and **Google Places api** relies on **JavaScript** and **JQuery** to search, filter and display the user results. 

The site is styled with **Bootstrap** and I have made the site responsive so users can use this single page application whilst on the go.

## Features
### Existing features
* Eye catching index page
* Large easy to see and use search box with fontawesome icon for user recognition
* Large Google map - filling lower half on index page so site functionality evident from the offset
* Clear search results using Bootstrap button info class

### Features left to implement
* None

## Technology used
* [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/)
    * Used to create mock ups of the site which have been uploaded as PDF files
* **Html**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**
    * Base languages used to create the site
* **Cloud9**
    * Code editor used to write above code
* **JQuery**
    *
* **Bootstrap** 3.3.7
    * Web framework used
* **Google maps api**
* **Google place api**
* **Github**
    * Platform used to host my versioning
* Other resources used: **Fontawesome**, **Googlefonts**

## Versioning
I used Git for versioning on this project.

## Testing
* HTML code checked via a [HTML code checker](https://validator.w3.org/)
* CSS code checked via [CSS code checker](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator)
* Asked colleagues, friends and family to check this site and access from their own devices; any small changes were made and committed.
* Used a [website response tool](https://www.responsinator.com) to test how well the website responded to different device sizes.
*  Checked every feature worked (and looked consistent) in:
    * Google Chrome
    * Internet Explorer 10
    * Microsoft Edge
    * Opera
*  Used incognito mode on **Google Chrome** to remove all cached data.
