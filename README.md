## Overview
### What is this website for?
This project required me to create a site that calls on the Google Maps API and/or the Google Places API (or similar) to allow users to search for their next holiday destination.

### What does this website do?
This website is motivated by that brief and uses the criteria supplied. It was imperative that I create a site that helps users to:
* Select a destination city
* Find tourist attractions
* Find accommodation
* Find bars and restaurants
* I also added travel as a filter option as I felt this was an essential feature on a travel site.

### How does it work?
This website uses the **Google Maps api** and the **Google Places api** allowing users to search for a holiday destination.

The site uses plain **HTML** and **CSS** to route users to search and filter destinations which, depending on their search style, controls which **JavaScript** to execute.

The **Google Maps api** and **Google Places api** relies on **JavaScript** and **JQuery** to search, filter and display the user results.

I applied **Google Places api: types** to the site so that the relevant 

The site is styled with **Bootstrap** and I have made the site responsive so users can use this single page application whilst on the go.

## Features
### Existing features
* Eye catching index page
* Large easy to see and use search box with fontawesome icon for user recognition
* Large Google map - filling lower half on index page so site functionality evident from the offset
* Clear search results using Bootstrap button info class

### Features left to implement
* None

* [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/)
    * Used to create mock ups of the site which have been uploaded as PDF files
* **Html**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**
    * Base languages used to create the site
* [Cloud9](https://c9.io/login)
    * Code editor used to write above code
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com/)
    *
* [Bootstrap 3.3.7](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/)
    * Web framework used

* [Google places api](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/intro)
* [Github](https://github.com/)
    * Platform used to host my versioning
* Other resources used: [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/), [Googlefonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

## Versioning
I used **Git** for versioning on this project.

## Testing
* HTML code checked via a [HTML code validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
* CSS code checked via a [CSS code validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator)
* Asked colleagues, friends and family to check this site and access from their own devices; any small changes were made and committed.
* Used a [website response tool](https://www.responsinator.com) to test how well the website responded to different device sizes.
*  Checked every feature worked (and looked consistent) in:
    * Google Chrome**
    * Internet Explorer 10**
    * Microsoft Edge**
    * Opera**
*  Used incognito mode on **Google Chrome** to remove all cached data.
